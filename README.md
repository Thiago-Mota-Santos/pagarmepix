## 👋 introduction

Simple project that creates a qrcode, created at the request of a friend of mine who has a business, his pain was that it took a long time to enter the cell phone application that has pix, enter the password, create a qrcode, put it on the screen and show it to the client. Or the simple fact that he had to speak the pix key orally to the customer, which also took some time, and then the customer would enter the value and have to show a receipt to see if everything was ok, the purpose of this application is to reduce this process and the The evolution of this MVP is to create even faster alternatives for carrying out this simple process. That's why I invite you to think with me about how to make this even faster.
